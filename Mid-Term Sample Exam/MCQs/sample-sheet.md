- 1️⃣ Calls a method from the child class.  
- 2️⃣ Calls a private method.  
- 3️⃣ Calls a method from the parent class.  
- 4️⃣ Calls a method from an unrelated class.  

---

#### **13. What will happen if a class does not override an abstract method?**  
✅ **Answer:** 1. **It will raise a `TypeError` when an object of that class is created.**  
- 1️⃣ It will raise a `TypeError` when an object of that class is created.  
- 2️⃣ The program will run without any errors.  
- 3️⃣ The method will be skipped.  
- 4️⃣ The method will execute with a default implementation.  

---

#### **14. Which of the following best describes multiple inheritance?**  
✅ **Answer:** 3. **A class inherits from more than one base class.**  
- 1️⃣ A class can only inherit from one parent class.  
- 2️⃣ A child class cannot override methods of multiple base classes.  
- 3️⃣ A class inherits from more than one base class.  
- 4️⃣ Python does not support multiple inheritance.  

---

#### **15. What is dynamic method dispatch in Python?**
